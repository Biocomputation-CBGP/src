In this directory we have an example with the input and output of the alignments with the different versions.

All results will be the output for the same set of reads (HC00422648) with the same organism (Pseudomonas putida KT2240)

Every folder will have different number of outputs in the respective directory, here we will explain the general purpose or description of each type of file

<h2>Input:</h2>

 - Pseudomonas_KT2240.csv is the annotated genome
  
 - Pseudomonas_KT2240.txt is the genome of the organism in FASTA format
  
 - HC00422648 is the directory with an example of sequencing output reads with a txt extension

<h2>Output:</h2>

 -  all_seq_aligned.tsv / all_seq_alligned.txt: tabular output of the BLAST with added header
  
 - table_reads_genes_description.csv:  final table in comma sepataed values format
  
 - all_seq_aligned.sam: sam output of the BLAST
