In this directory we have an example with the input and output of the alignments with the different versions
<h2>Input:<h2>
 - Pseudomonas_KT2240.csv is the annotated genome
  
 - Pseudomonas_KT2240.txt is the genome of the organism
  
 - HC00422648 is the directory with an example of reads being the txt the format

<h2>Output:<h2>
 - ... tabular output of the BLAST with added header
